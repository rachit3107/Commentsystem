# Commentsystem
Comment System with recursive reply system. 


# Usage

1. Clone the repo.
2. npm install
3. npm start

You will be routed to the login Page.For simplicity, I have created 3 Users by default:-

username: rachit3107
password: tophire

username: tophire
password: tophire

username: rentmojo
password: tophire


You will see 2 posts(I have hardcoded the post data).
Click on comment on any of the post. You will be routed to the post page where you can see the post data and the comment button.
On clicking you will be able to save the comment.
Each comment has a reply button. On clicking you will see another textbox where you can add reply.
To edit the comment, click on edit button.
Only the user who made the comment will be able to edit. Otherwise the edit button will be disabled.
